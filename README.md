# node_tabber

Node Tabber is a Houdini/Nuke style node adding tool for Blender's Node tree graphs; namely the Shader, Compositing and Texture graphs.

Instead of having to press SHIFT+A and then scrolling the sub menus to fins the correct node, or even clicking on the search menu and maybe getting the correct node; you can just press the TAB button which will bring up an intelligent search list which even supports node acronyms. For example, typing SX would bring up the Seperate XYZ node.
This saves a lot of time when working with large node trees.

## Installation

Head over to [releases](https://github.com/jiggymoon69/node_tabber/releases) and download the zip file, but do not unzip it, just save it somewhere local.In blender preferences, go to the addon section and select "install ...", locate the downloaded zip and it will appear under the addons. Just enable it and change any preferences you wish. 



## Note (November 17 2021)
This repo is probably temporary as the original author, and all credits should go for him JiggyMoon69 owns the original repository of this project.
the file is there since it works and people may need the recent changes, but this repo's changes will perhaps end up merged into original Master, which would be for the best.
